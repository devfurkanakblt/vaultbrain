# Delivery Roadmap

Each phase must ship a usable vertical slice and keep older vaults readable.

## Phase 0 — Product and security contract

- [x] Define positioning, non-negotiables and measurable performance budgets
- [x] Select desktop security boundary and target storage architecture
- [x] Map Obsidian-class baseline capabilities

## Phase 1 — Hardened compatibility core

- [x] Block traversal and symlink-based vault escape
- [x] Make encrypted writes crash-safe and atomic
- [x] Round-trip quotes, backslashes and multiline values
- [x] Generate collision-resistant UTC note keys
- [x] Automatically refresh the safe catalog after CLI writes
- [x] Add passphrase-authenticated audit chaining and verification command
- [x] Add build-backed regression tests
- [x] Version the encrypted envelope and add migration fixtures
- [x] Add masked/keychain-backed unlock and explicit lock lifecycle
- [x] Add concurrency-safe transactions and recovery simulation

## Phase 2 — Encrypted document engine

- [x] Stable note IDs, revisions, Markdown bodies and typed properties
- [x] Content-addressed, chunked encrypted attachments with integrity verification
- [x] Wikilink, heading, block reference and tag parser
- [x] Incremental backlink/unresolved-link index with rename invalidation
- [x] In-memory full-text search with ranking, filters and snippets
- [x] Encrypted revision history and deleted-note recovery
- [x] Idempotent daily notes and variable-driven encrypted templates
- [x] Obsidian-style YAML frontmatter semantic import/export
- [x] Comment/style-preserving frontmatter round-trip
- [x] Repeatable 1k-note performance corpus and CI-style p95 gates
- [x] 10k/100k production index gates

## Phase 3 — Desktop workspace

- [x] Tauri 2 application with capability-scoped commands
- [x] Polished Markdown editor and reading view
- [x] File explorer, outline, properties and backlinks
- [x] Tabs and pane splitting
- [x] Global search and command palette
- [x] Keyboard-driven quick switcher
- [x] Lock screen and explicit session lock
- [x] Inactivity lock and safe clipboard handling
- [x] Core keyboard shortcuts, responsive layout and reduced-motion support
- [x] Theme editor and virtualized large-vault UI

## Phase 4 — Knowledge views

- [x] Value-minimized local graph baseline from the encrypted link index
- [x] Global graph clustering and large-graph virtualization
- [x] Content-addressed encrypted attachments in the desktop core
- [x] Canvas/whiteboard with encrypted assets
- [x] Database-like property table with local filtering and column sorting
- [x] Saved property queries and editable cells
- [x] Bookmarks, workspaces, aliases and unlinked mentions
- [x] Optional on-device semantic recall

## Phase 5 — Controlled ecosystem and AI

- [x] Capability manifest and sandboxed plugin runtime
- [x] Signed plugin packages, restricted mode and revocation
- [x] Per-agent scoped grants with expiry and confirmation policies
- [x] Redaction-aware MCP results
- [x] Local-model adapter
- [x] Importer for Obsidian vaults with integrity report

## Phase 6 — Encrypted sync and mobile

- [x] Immutable encrypted change protocol and conflict resolution
  - [x] Content-addressed encrypted envelopes, device chains, causal DAG validation and deterministic conflict inspection
  - [x] Emit changes automatically from note/canvas/attachment transactions and apply resolved remote changes to live storage
  - [x] Capture plugin package and plugin-policy transactions
- [ ] Device enrollment, removal and key rotation
- [ ] Untrusted relay server and self-hosted option
- [ ] Desktop multi-device release, then iOS/Android clients
- [ ] External security audit, recovery drill and stable 1.0 format
